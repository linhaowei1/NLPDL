    "Word Vectors are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, translation, etc., so it is important to build some intuitions as to their strengths and weaknesses. Here, you will explore two types of word vectors: those derived from *co-occurrence matrices*, and those derived via *GloVe*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Terminology:** The terms \"word vectors\" and \"word embeddings\" are often used interchangeably. The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) states, \"*conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension*\"."

    "*You shall know a word by the company it keeps ([Firth, J. R. 1957:11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth))*\n",

    "Many word vector implementations are driven by the idea that similar words, i.e., (near) synonyms, will be used in similar contexts. As a result, similar words will often be spoken or written along with a shared subset of words, i.e., contexts. By examining these contexts, we can try to develop embeddings for our words. With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) or [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."

    "A co-occurrence matrix counts how often things co-occur in some environment. Given some word $w_i$ occurring in the document, we consider the *context window* surrounding $w_i$. Supposing our fixed window size is $n$, then this is the $n$ preceding and $n$ subsequent words in that document, i.e. words $w_{i-n} \\dots w_{i-1}$ and $w_{i+1} \\dots w_{i+n}$. We build a *co-occurrence matrix* $M$, which is a symmetric word-by-word matrix in which $M_{ij}$ is the number of times $w_j$ appears inside $w_i$'s window among all documents.\n",

    "The rows (or columns) of this matrix provide one type of word vectors (those based on word-word co-occurrence), but the vectors will be large in general (linear in the number of distinct words in a corpus). Thus, our next step is to run *dimensionality reduction*. In particular, we will run *SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)*, which is a kind of generalized *PCA (Principal Components Analysis)* to select the top $k$ principal components. Here's a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$.\n",

    "This reduced-dimensionality co-occurrence representation preserves semantic relationships between words, e.g. *doctor* and *hospital* will be closer than *doctor* and *dog*. \n",

    "**Notes:** If you can barely remember what an eigenvalue is, here's [a slow, friendly introduction to SVD](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as [Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD) — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively."
